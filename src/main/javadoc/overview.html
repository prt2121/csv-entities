	<p>The onebusaway-csv-entities project provides a library for
		mapping between CSV data files and Java objects, both for reading and
		writing.</p>
	<h2>Example</h2>

	<p>Consider the following CSV data file, "employees.csv":
	<pre>id,first_name,last_name,office,phone
123,Alice,Brown,New York,555-1234
456,Bob,Smith,San Francisco,</pre>

	<p>Here, our CSV data file defines a number of employee records,
		with a header defining the fields of the file and each row
		representing an employee. Let's say we wanted to map those employee
		records to the following class:</p>

	<pre>class Employee {
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private String office;
  private String phone;
}</pre>

	<h3>Schema Annotations</h3>

	<p>With a few simple annotations, we can define how to map the Java
		class to and from CSV:</p>

	<pre>{@literal @}CsvFields(filename="employees.csv")
class Employee {
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private String office;
  {@literal @}CsvField(optional=true)
  private String phone;
}</pre>

	<p>
		The primary annotation is <a
			href="org/onebusaway/csv_entities/schema/annotations/CsvFields.html">@CsvFields</a>,
		which indicates that the Java file can be mapped to and from entries
		in a CSV file. We even define the name of the file that should be
		written and read.
	</p>

	<p>
		By default, we map each field of the Java file to a field in the CSV
		file. Each field is considered required by default, which means the
		parser will throw an exception if a blank field value is found in the
		input CSV (or in the Java object, when writing CSV). However, in our
		example, not all phone number fields have been specified. So we
		annotate the field with a <a
			href="org/onebusaway/csv_entities/schema/annotations/CsvField.html">@CsvField</a>
		annotation, marking the field as optional. @CsvField annotations can
		be used to control how fields are serialized to and from CSV.
	</p>

	<h3>Reading Objects</h3>

	<p>Now that we've annotated our Java class, let's see how to read
		and build Java object instances from CSV data.</p>

	<pre>CsvEntityReader reader = new CsvEntityReader();
reader.addEntityHandler(new EntityHandler() { ... });
reader.readEntities(Employee.class, new FileReader("/path/to/employees.csv"));</pre>

	<p>
		First, we create a new <a
			href="org/onebusaway/csv_entities/CsvEntityReader.html">CsvEntityReader</a>
		object, which will do the heavy-lifting of reading CSV data and
		converting it into Java objects. Second, we register a new <a
			href="org/onebusaway/csv_entities/EntityHandler.html">EntityHandler</a>
		instance. EntityHandler is just an interface with a single method,
		"handleEntity", that gets called for each new Java entity created from
		a CSV data row. Provide your own implementation to handle entities as
		they are read and created. Finally, we direct the reader to read
		entities of our annotated type from the specified file.
	</p>

	<h3>Writing Objects</h3>

	<p>Writing entities is just as simple:</p>

	<pre>CsvEntityWriterFactory factory = new CsvEntityWriterFactory();
CsvEntityWriter writer = factory.createWriter(Employee.class, new FileWriter("/path/to/employees.csv"));
writer.handleEntity(new Employee());
writer.close();</pre>

	<h2>Next Steps</h2>

	<p>The OneBusAway CSV entities library can do a whole lot more than
		reading and writing simple Java objects from CSV. Read the JavaDoc
		documentation for more details.</p>
